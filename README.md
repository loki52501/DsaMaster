# DSA PROBLEMS I SOLVE DAILY

Today 26/09/2025 , I completed bubble sort, one step close to working in Google or Meta or Apple or Microsoft or Netflix.

I really want to use my programming skills in movie industry.

# Sorting Algorithms

Bubble sort: it's a basic swap and switch ;
Insertion sort: it's inserting a element into the sorted array by traversing through elements and locating the right place for the inserted element.
Selection sort: it's assuming that there is two subset of an array, one is sorted and the other is unsorted, we insert element one by one from unsorted array to sorted array by finding out the min/max depending on asc/desc order. 

everything here has the worst time complexity of O(n^2)
